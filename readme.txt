Git tracks changes.

I still love ZhaoNan.

git init : create a version managerment
git add  : add a new file to the git
git commit -m "XXX" : commit the modified transaction and name it
git status : check the present status of the git
git diff : show the difference between before and after
git log  : show the log of the commit
git log --pretty=oneline : lon will show in oneline
git reset --hard HEAD^/versionID : recover the version
git relog: show the operation that you modified to the git ( which is convient to get your recover ID)
